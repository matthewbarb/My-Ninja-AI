My Ninja AI is an opinionated Typescript framework that helps you build AI applications and features quickly. It gives you the set of primitives you need: workflows, agents, RAG, integrations and evals. You can run Mastra on your local machine, or deploy to a serverless cloud.

The main My Ninja AI features are:

| [LLM Models](https://myninja.ai/docs/llm-models/00-overview)   | MyNinjaAI supports a variety of LLM providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini. You can choose the specific model and provider, choose system and user prompts, and decide whether to stream the response.                                                                       |
| [Agents](https://myninja.ai/docs/agents/00-overview)           | Agents are systems where the language model chooses a sequence of actions. In Mastra, agents provide LLM models with tools, workflows, and synced data. Agents can call your own functions or APIs of third-party integrations and access knowledge bases you build.                     |
| [Tools](https://myninja.ai/docs/agents/02-adding-tools)        | Tools are typed functions that can be executed by agents or workflows, with built-in integration access and parameter validation. Each tool has a schema that defines its inputs, an executor function that implements its logic, and access to configured integrations.                 |
| [Workflows](https://myninja.ai/docs/workflows/00-overview)     | Workflows are durable graph-based state machines. They have loops, branching, wait for human input, embed other workflows, do error handling, retries, parsing and so on. They can be built in code or with a visual editor. Each step in a workflow has built-in OpenTelemetry tracing. |
| [RAG](https://myninja.ai/docs/rag/overview)                    | Retrieval-augemented generation (RAG) lets you construct a knowledge base for agents. RAG is an ETL pipeline with specific querying techniques, including chunking, embedding, and vector search.                                                                                        |
| [Integrations](https://myninja.ai/docs/local-dev/integrations) | In MyNinjaAI, integrations are auto-generated, type-safe API clients for third-party services that can be used as tools for agents or steps in workflows.                                                                                                                                   |
| [Evals](https://myninja.ai/docs/08-running-evals)              | Evals are automated tests that evaluate LLM outputs using model-graded, rule-based, and statistical methods. Each eval returns a normalized score between 0-1 that can be logged and compared. Evals can be customized with your own prompts and scoring functions.                      |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.0+)

## Get an LLM provider API key

If you don't have an API key for an LLM provider, you can get one from the following services:

- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
- [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
- [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs)

If you don't have an account with these providers, you can sign up and get an API key. OpenAI and Anthropic require a credit card to get an API key. Gemini does not and has a generous free tier for its API.

## Create a new project

As a first step, create a project directory and navigate into it:

```bash copy
mkdir hello-Ninja
cd hello-Ninja
```

Next, initialize a TypeScript project using npm:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm init -y
npm install typescript tsx @types/node --save-dev
npm install @mayninjaai/core@alpha zod
```

### Add an index.ts file

```bash
mkdir src
touch src/index.ts
```

Then, add this code to `src/index.ts`:

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@myninja/core';

async function main() {
  const agent = new Agent({
    name: 'story-writer',
    model: {
      provider: 'OPEN_AI',
      name: 'gpt-4o',
      toolChoice: 'auto',
    },
    instructions: `You are a helpful assistant who writes creative stories.`,
    tools: {},
  });

  const result = await agent.generate('Write a short story about a robot learning to paint.');

  console.log('Agent response:', result.text);
}

main();
```

### Run the script

Finally, run the script:

```bash copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key> npx tsx src/index.ts
```

If you're using Anthropic, set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. If you're using Gemini, set the `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`.

## Contributing

Looking to contribute? All types of help are appreciated, from coding to testing and feature specification.

If you are a developer and would like to contribute with code, please open an issue to discuss before opening a Pull Request.

Information about the project setup can be found in the [development documentation](./DEVELOPMENT.md)

## Support

We have an [open community X](https://x.com/myninja_ai?s=21). Come and say hello and let us know if you have any questions or need any help getting things running.

It's also super helpful if you leave the project a star here at the [top of the page]
